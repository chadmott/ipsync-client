## IP Sync

I have a Raspberry Pi lives at my house, behind normal internet, so the IP address is subject to change. I dont really care for the public DYNDNS type solutions, so I created a custom one. The client lives in a docker container, and the server is a lambda function. The lambda function can be found [I'm an inline-style link](https://github.com/chadmott/lambdas/tree/master/ipsync-server.
